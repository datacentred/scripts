To upgrade firmware on APC PDU's

ftp to the pdu
set mode to binary
upload the aos first
if you are currently running a 1.x firmware, you need to upload the 2.02 firmware first as ftp is broken
NOTE : going from 1x to 2x firmware will wipe the device names
quit the ftp client
allow the pdu to reboot
ftp in again
you should see that the ftp server now matches the new firmware version number
set binary mode again
upload the rpdu firmware
allow the unit to reboot again
if you now telnet or ssh in, on the first screen you should see :
Stat : P+ N+ A+
This screen should also show both the app and AOS at the new version

If the app doesnt work from the web interface, you probably forgot to set binary mode when uploading
Re-upload the rpdu in binary mode and all should be fine

To get and put configs :

wget ftp://pdu16/config.ini --user=root --password=$password
ncftpput -u root -p $password pdu16 / config.ini
